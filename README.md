# viral_variant_pipeline

## Overview:
This pipeline was prepared by the [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/) for Yinda Kwe Claude (kweclaudey2@nih.gov).  It was tested with minION reads expected to map to reference genomes for Nipah virus and Hendra virus.  The goal is to identify variants in new samples in relation to the reference provided.

The pipeline and dependancies have been packaged on a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) image to allow it to run on your local machine. To obtain this image you will need a [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) account.

This repository defines how the pipeline works, and how the Docker image was created. In addition to this, a small helper script has been added to simplify interaction with the Docker container, see Requirements.

## Requirements:
- A DockerHub account, which you have logged into on the command line. (See Environment Setup below).
- [This](https://github.com/niaid/viral_variant_pipeline/blob/master/run_pipe.sh) script.


## Environment Setup:
This only needs to do be done once OR if the image has been changed and you want to run the updated version.

- Log in to docker and download the image:

```sh
docker login
# enter details
```


## Running the pipeline:

If you are running Darwin (OSX) or Linux the pipeline can be run using [this](https://github.com/niaid/viral_variant_pipeline/blob/master/run_pipe.sh) script.
Set the following environment variables:

- `INPUTS`: The path to the directory containing your fastq inputs.
- `REF_SEQ`: The path to the single reference fasta file which the fastq files will be compared to.
- `OUTPUTS`: The path to the directory that will be created for the outputs.

This might look something like this:

```sh
export INPUTS=/home/macmenaminpe/data/test_chikungunya_fq/
export REF_SEQ=/home/macmenaminpe/data/ref/GCF_000854045.1_ViralProj14998_genomic.fna
export OUTPUTS=/home/macmenaminpe/test_outputs_dir
```

Run the pipeline (In this example I'm setting AD to 10 and PL to 20):

```sh
run_pipe.sh -a 10 -p 20

Parameters used (view details in https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html):
-a : Minimium allele depth (AL) in at least one sample
-p : Phred-scaled genotype likelihoods (PL)
```

Additionally you can run mafft phylip:

```sh
run_pipe.sh -a 10 -p 20 -m
```

Or mafft clustal:

```sh
run_pipe.sh -a 10 -p 20 -c
```

Or both mafft phylip and clustal:

```sh
run_pipe.sh -a 10 -p 20 -c -m
```


Look at your results:
```sh
ls $OUTPUTS
```

## Outputs:
1. VCF file with variants
2. plots of coverage (pdf)
3. consensus sequence for each sample (fasta)
4. multi fasta file of all consensus sequences
5. log file

## Summary of Mapping and Variant Calling Steps:

- FASTQ files are filtered and trimmed with Nanofilt (-q 8 -l 500 --headcrop 50).  
- Reads are then aligned to the reference genome using minimap2(x) and parameter -ax map-ont.  
- Variants are called using both samtools and bcftools.  
- Coverage plots are created using R from a bedgraph file generated using bedtools and plotted with R ggplot2 package. 
- A consensus sequence was generated for each sample incorporating variants called.  
- All consensus sequences are finally aligned together with the reference sequence using mafft with default parameters.  (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/))
